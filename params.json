As of the time of this\r\nwriting much of the library is Java-based: not for efficiency, but for ease of\r\nintegration in other research NLP projects. C versions exist for some subsets of\r\nthe library, which may be distributed in the future.\r\n\r\nI (@vandurme) am unlikely to respond to emails asking for support, but if you feel you've\r\ndiscovered a bug (not too unlikely), or have something you'd like to contribute,\r\nthen feel free to issue a pull request via GitHub.\r\n\r\nTo reference this package in academic writing:\r\n\r\n@TechReport{Jerboa:TR:2012,\r\n author =       {Benjamin {Van Durme}},\r\n title =        {Jerboa: A Toolkit for Randomized and Streaming Algorithms},\r\n institution =  {Human Language Technology Center of Excellence, Johns Hopkins University},\r\n year =         {2012},\r\n number =       {7}\r\n}\r\n\r\nwhich can be found at: http://cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/papers/JerboaTR2012.pdf\r\n\r\nCopyright 2010-2012 Benjamin Van Durme.
